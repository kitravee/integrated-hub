# Work

On a mission to build products developers [love](/n/devtools), and along the way, teach the next generation of developers. Here's a summary of my work so far.

## Vercel

<Small>VP of Product</Small>

I joined [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) early to grow [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and our developer community. I built our Developer Relations team to teach the community about our products.

We spoke at conferences, wrote blog posts, and created videos. We built open-source examples and contributed back to the [product](/n/devtools). We [translated customer pain](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1105985400110112768) back into the product roadmap. I [shipped](https://x.com/leerob/status/1841226051554308229) a lot of code.

Since joining Vercel in 2020, Next.js has grown 1000%, now with 1 million active developers. Next.js is one of the top software projects on GitHub and used to build [wonderful products](https://nextjs.org/showcase).

## Hy-Vee

<Small>Senior Software Engineer, 2018 - 2020</Small>

Hy-Vee, an almost 100-year-old grocery chain in the United States, wanted to build a new version of their digital storefront. I joined a team of [product engineers](/n/product-engineers) working across web and mobile to rebuild their legacy .NET application (~500k MAU) with React and React Native.

On the frontend, I led our move from a custom webpack and React configuration to Next.js and the latest React patterns. In the process, I shared my learnings online, helping educate members of the React and Next.js community by creating courses.

Throughout my two years, I was able to work on some hard problems: decoupling a decade old monolith into microservices, working with a federated GraphQL API, learning and occasionally managing a Kubernetes cluster, building and implementing a design system, incrementally migrating individual components and routes to a new framework and infrastructure, and more.

## Workiva

<Small>Software Engineer, 2015 - 2018</Small>

Workiva ($WK) is a cloud platform for data reporting and compliance. During my time at Workiva, I gained my first production experience using React. I worked on tooling to help predict and alert and regressions in our SaaS platform, building a product similar to open-source tools like Sentry.
